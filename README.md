# Using Recurrent NN Layers with Pytorch Geometric (PyG)
This Module allows creation of RNN layers within a PyG model without going through a padded tensor.
Creating a padded tensor can be very prohibitive for a dataset with big lead and long tail For example, it you have 1 million groups of events, where most groups have 3-5 events (long take), but some have about 1000, you will need to create a padded tensor $1000000*1,000*n$, where $n$ is the number of properties within each event. That can be 100 times more space than needed
